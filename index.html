	<h2 id="introduction"><a> Introduction</a></h2>
	<p>
	Welcome to my homepage.  This page tells you a little about me
	and my skills.
	</p>
	<p>
	I am a 21 year old university graduate from London. During my freetime, I love to explore new cuisines, whether it be trying new restaurants or making different dishes. I also enjoy watching live music, having recently gone to my first concert since the end of lockdown, I look forward to going to many more. I believe it is important to ensure you have beneficial physical and mental health, therefore I regularly workout at the gym, play football and read books aimed to gain a greater understanding on having a postitive mental well-being.
	</p>
	<p>
	In terms of my skills, specifically in terms of programming languages, I have experience in database development and management
	using PostgreSQL. I also have experience using Java, Python, Pandas, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, C and C++  as well as knowledge of Agile Methodologies such as Scrum. 
	an alphabet soup of Internet technologies such as HTML, SVG, XML, XSLT, JSON and some others which I forgot.
